This script automagically checks URLs against given keywords. Matched
keywords are printed next to the URL to help you guess at the URL contents.
There is also a regex blacklist, see the output of "/set urlcheck".

Both the keyword and blacklist items are separated by single commas.

To use, simply copy urlcheck.pl to your ~/.irssi/scripts and
/script load urlcheck.
